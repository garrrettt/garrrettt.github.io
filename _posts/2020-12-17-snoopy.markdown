## The Story
I was working with 2 friends on a final project for my Artificial Intelligence class - our idea was to build an AI powered Snoopy game (from Charlie Brown). I took the responsibility to make the game's front-end but hadn't used any game engines, so I set out to do everything from scratch. What resulted after 2 weeks was a basic 2D game engine. See the clips below!

## Quick Clips
### Simulation of 2D bodies (Snoopy!)

### Cut between virtual cameras (each can have a different zoom and centering)

### Shake Effect - cameras can have time-based effects (like a basic version of shaders)
