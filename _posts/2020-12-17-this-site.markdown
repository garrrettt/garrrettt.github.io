#### Why Jekyll?
I chose to modify an existing Jekyll theme because I believed that would be the most efficient and
customizable way to make a portfolio website. I could have chosen to make a custom site in React,
perhaps with Gatsby or Next, but since I have some Ruby knowledge (I learned Ruby on
Rails on Codecademy years ago), I figured that it would be easy enough to download and customize a
Jekyll theme and customize it to my liking. 

In terms of development philosophy, I think it's important to ship a product, and the language and
framework should be chosen to guarentee that a good product ships. That's exactly why I chose to use
Jekyll because I knew that would be the fastest way to write a personal website. 

With all that said, I hope you like it! Feedback is always appreciated via GitHub issues if you
notice bugs or have a suggestion.
