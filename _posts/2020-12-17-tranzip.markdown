I made Tranzip with my friend [Kaleb Davenport](https://github.com/theearlynerd/) in November of
2016 for CodeTN. In terms of technical details, I built the backend database with MongoDB and server
with Node.js. I also wrote the front-end Javascript, like the interactions you see with the map. My
friend Kaleb worked on the CSS and general layout of the site.

We wanted to make Tranzip to address the problem that students were getting on the wrong buses
because they didn't know which one they rode on. After asking around, we learned that the bus system 
was all done on physical maps and was difficult to find information about as a student. So we
decided to build a web app that allows administrators to easily build and edit bus routes while also
allowing students to find their bus routes easily. 

Unfortunately, after CodeTN concluded and we had finished our project, the administrators at our 
local school system did not want to adopt a new bus system. Regardless, it displays my knowledge of 
Express.js as well as MongoDB and basic authentication. This site also features authentication by 
hashing and salting a username and password to store in
the server and then authenticating by checking a hashed password againsted the stored hash. I used
the bcrypt.js library to hash and salt the passwords.

Here are a few screen recordings to demonstrate functionality.

#### Searching for a bus route
<img class="image" src="/assets/images/Tranzip/search address.gif" alt="Searching for your bus routes in our database of bus routes.">
Above, you can see me searching for an address to find which buses I should go use. The site returns
the routes that are closest to the given address. We only loaded in a handful of addresses from
various official routes to test the site, so the results shown are not as large as a full bus route.

#### Adding waypoints to a bus route

Above, you can see me adding waypoints to a bus route and persisting them into a database.

#### Creating a bus

Above, you can see me creating a new bus within the site.

#### Deleting waypoints from a bus route
