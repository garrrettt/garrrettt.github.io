<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>I have primarily worked with Flutter for app development and React for web development. I have also worked with Java for class projects. See my projects page for more info.</p>
<p>Aside from specific technologies, I believe that good documentation and abstraction are critical for high quality code. Documenting my classes, methods, variables, etc. with descriptions and types is essential for other programmers to understand and work with my code quickly. I also believe that a well thought-out README file can provide the necessary base knowledge for a new engineer to quickly come up to speed on a project.</p>
<p>I also work to establish healthy levels of abstraction in my projects. For the non-technical, this means that I try to design my code in a way that it can be changed, modified, or re-used to meet changing business needs. For the technical, this means designing classes, components, and interfaces such that they are loosely coupled together and can be changed, removed, or replaced at a later date. In this way, I try to adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID principles</a> and actively read about effective design patterns in the frameworks and languages that I work with.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I am a junior by credit hours majoring in Computer Science & Cognitive Psychology at Northeastern University with a 4.00/4.00 GPA. In terms of relevant CS course material, I have taken both Object Oriented Design as well as Intro to Algorithms. I've found that both of these courses have helped me to understand how to implement modular and fast code. I chose a combined major with psychology because I think it's important to understand people, motivations, and how we interact with the world around us including the ever-changing technological landscape. I find psychology fascinating and useful when I'm thinking about problems that users of a product might have. The pscyhology part of my major gives me a foundation of knowledge on top of my CS/Software Engineering knowledge that I think will show through my projects and work.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>Recently, I've been trying to teach myself guitar and how to sing better. It's been a lot of fun, and I'm hoping to get to a point where I can jam with other musicians! When possible, I also enjoy getting out with friends to play frisbee golf or go on hikes or walks. I also really enjoy reading about neurotechnology, electric vehicle technology, and quantum computing.</p>
<p>That said, Iâ€™m always happy to try something new! Here's me finally juggling after a lot of practice.</p>
