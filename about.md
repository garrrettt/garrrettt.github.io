<h2>Work Philosophy</h2>
I have primarily worked with Flutter for app development and React for web development. I have also worked with Java for class projects. See my projects page for more info.

Aside from specific technologies, I believe that good documentation and abstraction are critical for
high quality code. Documenting my code with descriptions, well thought out types, and a README is
essential for other programmers to understand and work with my code quickly. I believe that good
code is loosely coupled and modular leading to high maintainability and adaptability to changing
business needs.

<h2>Education</h2>
Northeastern University Class of ‘23 (Junior by credit hours)
Major: Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology Combined Major
GPA: 4.00 (unweighted), Dean’s List all semesters
Relevant Courses: Object Oriented Design, Algorithms and Data, Discrete Structures

I am a junior by credit hours majoring in Computer Science & Cognitive Psychology at Northeastern
University with a 4.00/4.00 GPA. In terms of relevant CS course material, I have taken several CS
classes including Object Oriented Design, Intro to Algorithms, and Discrete Structures. 

In addition to my CS major, I chose to add Cognitive Psychology to my major because knowledge of psychology helps to give
me a broader perspective, learning how other people think, act, and get motivated. The pscyhology part of
my major gives me a foundation of knowledge on top of my CS/Software Engineering knowledge that I
think will show through my projects and work.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
Recently, I've been trying to teach myself guitar and how to sing better. It's been a lot of fun, and I'm hoping to get to a point where I can jam with other musicians! When possible, I also enjoy getting out with friends to play frisbee golf or go on hikes or walks. I also really enjoy reading about neurotechnology, electric vehicle technology, and quantum computing.

That said, I’m always happy to try something new! Here's me finally juggling after a lot of practice.
