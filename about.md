<h2>Work Philosophy</h2>

Aside from specific technologies (see resume for skill list), I believe that good documentation and abstraction are critical for
high quality code. Documenting my code with descriptions, well thought out types, and a README is
essential for other programmers to understand and work with my code quickly. I believe that good
code is tested, loosely coupled, and modular, leading to high maintainability and adaptability to changing
business needs.

<h2>Education</h2>

- Northeastern University Class of ‘23
- Major: Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology Combined Major
- GPA: 3.96 / 4.00, Dean’s List all semesters, Honors Program, President’s Award (Apr. 2021)

In addition to my CS major, I chose to add Cognitive Psychology to my major because I love thinking
about social dynamics, whether its the dynamics between a product and its users or the dynamics
between team members. I believe that good company social dynamics shine through to the products they
produce.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
Recently, I've been playing a lot of guitar! It's been a lot of fun, and I'm hoping to get to a point where I can jam with other musicians! I also love rock climbing, long-distance cycling, and disc golf!

That said, I’m always happy to try something new! Here's me finally juggling after a lot of practice.
