<h2>Work Philosophy</h2>
I have primarily worked with Flutter for app development and React for web development. I have also worked with Java for class projects. See my projects page for more info.

Aside from specific technologies, I believe that good documentation and abstraction are critical for
high quality code. Documenting my code with descriptions, well thought out types, and a README is
essential for other programmers to understand and work with my code quickly. I believe that good
code is tested, loosely coupled, and modular, leading to high maintainability and adaptability to changing
business needs.

<h2>Education</h2>

- Northeastern University Class of ‘23 (Junior by credit hours)
- Major: Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology Combined Major
- GPA: 4.00 (unweighted), Dean’s List all semesters, Honors Program
- Relevant Courses: Object Oriented Design, Algorithms and Data, Discrete Structures, 
Artificial Intelligence, Foundations of Data Science, Bostonography

In addition to my CS major, I chose to add Cognitive Psychology to my major because I love thinking
about social dynamics, whether its the dynamics between a product and its users or the dynamics
between team members. I believe that good company social dynamics shine through to the products they
produce.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
Recently, I've been trying to teach myself guitar and how to sing better. It's been a lot of fun, and I'm hoping to get to a point where I can jam with other musicians! When possible, I also enjoy getting out with friends to play frisbee golf or go on hikes or walks. I also really enjoy reading about neurotechnology, electric vehicle technology, and augmented reality.

That said, I’m always happy to try something new! Here's me finally juggling after a lot of practice.
